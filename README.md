# cordovademo
Based on some demo code taken from Pluralsight michelotti
And augmented on the ionic tabs-chat starter app

Includes simple hard-coded examples of
* Dialogs
* Vibrate
* Camera
* Barcode
* Device Info
* Network status
* App Availability
* Send SMS Text Message

Now also looked into the ionic chapter of the MEAN Stack training on MongoDB website
See https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-mongodb-using-mean-stack-mongodbx-m101x

Highly recommended course for Front-End developers wanting to get a head start with ionic

I am hoping to enhance this from time to time.
The code is tested on
iPhone6 iOS 9.2.1, cordova 3.8.0
Nexus 5X Android version 6.0.1, cordova 5.1.0
iPad 3.1, iOS 9.2.1, cordova 3.8.0
Trying to build on Windows 8 for the Nokia 630
